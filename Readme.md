Company Name: Ad Results Media,

Application for  Front End / Full Stack Software Engineer position

Several of my projects over the past years make heavy use of CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript, AJAX, XHTML, XML/DOM, Sass, distributed version control systems such as GIT, BEM naming conventions, front-end frameworks like Angular, React, Redux, package manager and build tools like NPM, WebPack, rest API back-end servers with NodeJs, Python(flask and Django), NoSQL Databases like MongoDB and SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, as well as constant solving of data structure and algorithm challenges in both Java and JavaScript, via which I have gained a somewhat deep understanding of these technologies. In addition, I am always open and excited to learn new technologies.

My most recent work is a geneosocial application,(private social media just for family members) though this application is to reach its full potential, you can create posts (upload both video and audio), edit posts, comment posts, like a post all on real-time, edit profile, write comments with emojis, discover post of family member you have not followed, follow family members, real-time chat system, real-time notification, upload both photo and video on the chat app, share the post with other social sites and much much more all in the app documentation.

photos of the site can be seen on my portfolio website

I am applying because growth within a vibrant team and culture has been my
dream.

I am hoping to move to an in-house role so I can get my teeth stuck into the business and see the result of my hard work.
In addition to this mail is my resume attachment.
