    about:"Islam, major world religion promulgated(promote or make widely known) by the Prophet Muhammad in Arabia in the 7th century CE. The Arabic term islām, literally “surrender,” illuminates the fundamental religious idea of Islam—that the believer (called a Muslim, from the active particle of islām) accepts surrender to the will of Allah (in Arabic, Allāh: God). Allah is viewed as the sole God—creator, sustainer, and restorer of the world. The will of Allah, to which human beings must submit, is made known through the sacred scriptures, the Qurʾān (often spelled Koran in English), which Allah revealed to his messenger, Muhammad. In Islam Muhammad is considered the last of a series of prophets (including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Solomon, and Jesus), and his message simultaneously consummates and completes the “revelations” attributed to earlier prophets.",

          details1:"Islam is a word with multiple connotations. It is derived from an Arabic stem that carries the meanings of peace and submission (to Allah the Exalted and Almighty). All Abrahamic religions were sent down to discipline mankind and prepare them spiritually, physically, and intellectually in the way that is best for the fulfilment of the mission they are created for. Allah’s Messages are meant to build up the human being fit for establishing civilization and creating prosperity in the world. For this end, Allah commands us to do what is beneficial to us and forbids all that cause harm to us.",
          details2:"Abrahamic religions were sent down to liberate human minds and render them enlightened and mature through the divine light. Religion is not meant to be in contrast to reason and truth. Rather, it is meant to be in harmony with reason and help develop and illuminate it.",
          details3:"If the world’s nations look truly forward to achieving world peace, the only way left for them is to embrace the Message of Allah that is based on establishing peace between man and Allah, and man and man.",
          details4:"Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said in his teachings: “Allah shows Mercy to those who are merciful to others. Show mercy to those on earth and He up in heaven will show Mercy to you.” [Reported by Abu-Dawud (4943) and At-Tirmidhi (1924) on the authority of `Abdullah ibn `Amr (may Allah be pleased with him), and classified by At-Tirmidhi as Hasan Sahih.",
          details5:"Moreover, the Glorious Qur’an describes our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) saying: “We have not sent you but as a mercy to the worlds.” [Surat Al Anbiya’: 107]",

          details7:"Islam establishes the greeting of peace for its adherents as an invocation of peace and mercy to be exchanged whenever they meet.",
          details8:"In fact, Islam was not revealed to abrogate the previous Messages of Allah, but rather to renew and perfect them. Therefore, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “My similitude in comparison with the other Prophets before me is that of a man who has built a house nicely and beautifully, except for a place of one brick in a corner. The people go round about it and wonder at its beauty, but say: “Would that this brick be put in its place!” So I am the last (final) of the Prophets.” [Reported by Al-Bukhari (3342) and Muslim 22-(2286) on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him)].",
          details9:"Allah (Glory is to Him) says in the Glorious Qur’an: “Say: We believe in Allah and (in) that which had been revealed to us, and (in) that which was revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and (in) that which was given to Musa and Isa, and (in) that which was given to the prophets from their Lord, we do not make any distinction between any of them, and to Him do we submit.” [Surat Al-Baqarah: 136].",
          details10:"In this regard, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) also said: “I have the best claim to ‘Isa, son of Mariam, among the whole of mankind in this worldly life and the next life. Prophets are brothers in faith, having different mothers. Their religion is one but their mothers are different.” [Reported by Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (Sahih Bukhari (3259) and Sahih Muslim 143-(2365))].",
          details11:"Thus, Jesus (peace be upon him) was not sent to abolish the Message of Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) nor was Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) sent to strip Jesus of prophethood. Rather, each Prophet was sent to confirm the Message of his predecessor and pave the way for his successor. The Glorious Qur’an is the aggregate source that gathers the essence and wisdom of all the previous divine Messages. It calls for believing in all the Prophets; they have all been taught and sent by the One God: Allah, to Whom all Majesty belongs.",

A hasan (literally: good) hadith is one that does not contain a disparaged transmitter in its chain and which is reported through more than one route of narration, with a chain containing truthful and reliable transmitters, but who are a degree less in their preservation/memory of hadith in comparison to the reporters of sahih hadith.",

          details4:" Muslims view Hadith as the second major source for Islamic law and dogma.",
          details5:"In effect, however, Hadith are arguably more important than the Qurʾan. While the Qurʾan is the foundation of authority in Islam, it provides few legal injunctions. The details of Islamic law are far more commonly derived from Hadith, and many tenets of Islamic theology and dogma come not from the Qurʾan but from Hadith (for example, a belief in the Antichrist). Unlike the Qurʾan, which was compiled and standardized during and immediately after Muhammad’s life, the Hadith were set down gradually during a period of five centuries after the beginning of Islam.",
          details6:"This presented the serious problem of Hadith forgery, with the different groups and schools of thought that emerged during the early Muslim civil wars and intellectual debates all creating Hadith to support their points of view. Muslim scholars developed the isnad as a tool for trying to distinguish authentic from forged Hadith based on the reliability and reputation of the transmitters who made up the isnad. ",
          details7:"The question of when one should believe a Hadith based on the fact that it had been attributed to Muhammad’s divine inspiration or reject it because its meaning seemed unacceptable has remained a contentious issue among Muslim scholars. Since they believed in Muhammad’s prophethood, Muslim scholars did not think it unusual for Hadith to predict future events or describe things that a typical person could not know. Western scholars who began evaluating the historical reliability of the Hadith corpus in the 19th century did not share these assumptions. Because there are no surviving textual records of Hadith from the actual time of the Prophet, Western scholars have questioned the authenticity of the Hadith corpus in general, with many reasoning that the Hadith tradition was elaborated as part of the growth of Islam and not as its original foundation.",

The creeds of various Christian denominations generally hold in common Jesus as the Son of God—the Logos incarnated—who ministered, suffered, and died on a cross, but rose from the dead for the salvation of mankind; and referred to as the gospel, meaning the "good news".

There are, in fact,  more Abrahamic religions, such as the Baha’i Faith, Yezidi, Druze, Samaritan and Rastafari, but this article will focus on the main three aforementioned. The term ‘Abrahamic’ highlights the hugely important role which the figure of Abraham plays in each of these traditions.

Trouble brews between Sarah and Hagar as their sons grow up, and Sarah persuades Abraham to send Hagar and Ishmael away (Genesis 21). God promises Hagar that Ishmael too will be made into a great nation. God then tests Abraham’s faith by commanding him to sacrifice Isaac (Genesis 22). But when Abraham is about to sacrifice Isaac on Mount Moriah, an angel stops him and directs his gaze to a ram caught in the thicket. The ram is sacrificed instead of Isaac.",

Passages such as Acts of the Apostles 2:36 show that some early Christian writers knew that the Christ was properly a title, but in many passages of the New Testament, including those in the letters of the Apostle Paul, the name and title are combined and used together as Jesus’ name: Jesus Christ or Christ Jesus (Romans 1:1; 3:24).

According to Matthew and Luke, however, Joseph was only legally his father. They report that Mary was a virgin when Jesus was conceived and that she “was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 1:18; cf. Luke 1:35). Joseph is said to have been a carpenter (Matthew 13:55)—that is, a craftsman who worked with his hands—and, according to Mark 6:3, Jesus also became a carpenter.",

As a young adult, he went to be baptized by the prophet John the Baptist and shortly thereafter became an itinerant preacher and healer (Mark 1:2–28). In his mid-30s Jesus had a short public career, lasting perhaps less than one year, during which he attracted considerable attention. Sometime between 29 and 33 CE—possibly 30 CE—he went to observe Passover in Jerusalem, where his entrance, according to the Gospels, was triumphant and infused with eschatological significance. While there he was arrested, tried, and executed. His disciples became convinced that he rose from the dead and appeared to them.
