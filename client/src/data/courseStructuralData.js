Even if you have no intention of becoming a web developer yourself, this material should help you gain a useful understanding of the moving parts involved in creating and serving content on the web.\n We will start by getting familiar with the internet and your own computer. Next, we’ll work on setting up a development environment and learning about Git and GitHub. Then, we’ll go over the basics of front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript before stepping into the back end with a brief foray that covers the basic concepts of back-end technologies.\n By the end of this unit, you should not only understand how the web works but also be able to identify and differentiate between all the technologies that you will use to build your own web applications. You will be able to build a simple webpage, style it, and add minor elements of interactivity while working comfortably from the command line.\n This section intentionally covers a very broad range of topics. It’s silly to go diving straight into server-side programming without having a context for what it is and why it’s useful (and why you should learn it!).",

Some of the lessons will ask you to complete exercises. In addition, we provide several projects throughout the curriculum to help you grow your understanding by actually building things.\n Try not to think of programming, as a class in school. It’s not material you learn all at once to take a test, and then pass or fail. You can think of it as a snowball. You, yourself, are a snowball. You’re rolling down a hill full of snow and the further you roll; the more snow will stick to you. Sure, snow will also fall off you, and you’ll forget things often, but that’s just part of the process. Don’t be scared if you get to a project and you feel like you haven’t retained or memorized anything. That’s natural and happens to everyone.

We also encourage you to seek out additional resources that teach about these topics in your own native language so you can understand them more fully.\nIn addition to this, you might also consider using a translation dictionary in your own language alongside our curriculum so you can readily reference it as you go. We do not have any recommendations on these since there are such a wide variety of languages spoken throughout the world, finding one may perhaps be a good first step in learning how to find useful tools online by searching.

The client could be a tech company, an organization, or a government. The work could involve front-end, back-end, or full-stack web development.\nWeb development could be a good profession for you if you like solving logical problems, building useful things, and experimenting with new technologies. Web developers are in high demand, generally have a good work/life balance, and command comfortable salaries.

Front-end developers use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and their relevant frameworks to ensure that content is presented effectively and that users have an excellent experience.\n The back end refers to the guts of the application, which live on the server. The back end stores and serves program data to ensure that the front end has what it needs. This process can become very complicated when a website has millions of users. Back-end developers use programming languages like Java, Python, and Ruby to work with data.\n Full-stack developers are comfortable working with both the front and back ends. At The Odin Project, we focus on teaching you full-stack development, covering all aspects of web development.\n For more detail, Udacity has a great blog post on this topic: 3 Web Dev Careers Decoded: Front-End vs Back-End vs Full Stack",

If you successfully meet these expectations, they offer excellent pay, benefits, and opportunities.\n Startups are a bit like the wild west. For a junior developer, it can feel like a trial by fire because of the pace of development. Startups often offer slightly lower salaries and require longer hours, but they may also offer equity in the company and highly unique environments.\nAs a freelancer, you could command a strong hourly wage and the freedom to schedule and design your own products. However, you would be responsible for getting your own work (which means less coding time), managing billing from clients (which can be difficult), and being solely responsible. Strong people skills are necessary for this path.\nAs a consultant for a web consultancy, you would give up some of your freelancing wage potential but be able to focus more on the code and less on the hustle. This option also provides a good work/life balance and pay.\nFinally, large, older companies still need web developers.

In fact, the vast majority of sites listed in our results aren't manually submitted for inclusion, but are found and added automatically when our web crawlers crawl the web.\n Google Search works in essentially three stages:\nCrawling: Google searches the web with automated programs called crawlers, looking for pages that are new or updated. Google stores those page addresses (or page URLs) in a big list to look at later. We find pages by many different methods, but the main method is following links from pages that we already know about.\nIndexing: Google visits the pages that it has learned about by crawling, and tries to analyze what each page is about. Google analyzes the content, images, and video files in the page, trying to understand what the page is about. This information is stored in the Google index, a huge database that is stored on many computers.\n Serving search results: When a user searches on Google, Google tries to determine the highest quality results. The 'best' results have many factors, including things such as the user's location, language, device (desktop or phone), and previous queries. For example, searching for 'bicycle repair shops' would show different answers to a user in Paris than it would to a user in Hong Kong.

Focus mode occurs when you are consciously focusing on learning, reading, watching videos, or working on a project. Diffuse mode occurs subconsciously, at times when you are not actively learning, such as when you’re doing the dishes, exercising, or sleeping. In this state, your mind goes about the business of connecting what you have been learning to the other things you know. This is where breakthroughs happen.\nIt’s important to know that your mind goes through these two states when learning because you can utilise this to make your learning more efficient. When stuck on a concept or project, taking a break to refresh and let your subconscious work on making connections more often than not yields a solution to your problem. The trick is to put effort into solving the problem first and then take a break.\nIn short, understand it, practice it, and finally teach it.\nTeaching what you know to others is a great way to solidify what you have learned and can often reveal holes in your knowledge that you wouldn’t have identified otherwise.\nYou can practice this method of learning by helping others in our community.(the odin project community)",

            detail:"You will have more success with Odin by putting consistent time into it rather than working on it once a week. Building a habit of studying every day at a specific time and with a specific goal will ensure that you make consistent progress.\nIt may take you longer than others to grasp concepts, or it may take you less time. This doesn’t mean you’re smarter or dumber than others, it means you’ve had differing life experiences that may or may not have prepared you for learning this stuff. Someone who grew up around an engineer may have some advantages over someone who didn’t, but it doesn’t mean you can’t learn those skills.\nThe Odin Project isn’t like college or university, it is self paced and allows you to get a really solid grasp of concepts before moving on. In school, you’re forced to keep up or you will fail. The difference here is that coming into The Odin Project, you’re not expected to have much knowledge; there are no prerequisites. We’ve had people be successful coming through here that only knew how to check their email with a computer. We’ve also seen success from computer science degree holders. Treating The Odin Project like a static timeline is understandable, but is a sign of misplaced expectations. You simply don’t know what you don’t know yet, and that’s OK! There’s no due-dates on things in The Odin Project so you can spend the time to do it right and discuss the topics.\nDeadlines cause un-needed stress. Since The Odin Project is a free and open platform, you are not beholden to a deadline. Creating your own deadlines is a good way to rush concepts that should not be rushed. This course is very research based, meaning you will have to do research to complete tasks and projects. There’s no telling if you can find the article or post that helps you in the right way, quickly to meet your deadlines, but I bet you learned a TON along the way that you can use in the future. People that do this kind of research and strive to write better solutions tend to become better developers in the future. There’s no knowing how long it could take you to learn how to query stuff to find your answers. There are no solid guidelines on that. If you’re doing The Odin Project because you need a high paying job right-now, you’re not going to become a solid developer within the timeframe you have set. Stress and anxiety absolutely do not help you learn either. Relax and just enjoy the ride.\nLong story short: Don’t worry, just go learn",

Try your best to avoid these.\n==>Procrastination::Procrastination will be your biggest enemy when trying to make progress.==>Solution:: The Pomodoro Technique(The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.[1] It uses a timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.) is a way of managing your time in order to stay focused. The idea is to set a timer for 25 minutes and to work on a task until the timer goes off. If you get distracted or interrupted during the 25 minutes, start the 25 minutes of work over again. Once you’ve successfully focused on work for 25 minutes, take a 5 minute break. When your break is over, repeat the 25 minutes of work and 5 minute break. After you’ve completed four 25 minute blocks of work, take a longer 15-30 minute break.\nThe Pomodoro technique is great for avoiding procrastination as it forces you to work without distractions. Since the work time only lasts 25 minutes before taking a break, it’s not overwhelming, making it harder to rationalize procrastination.",

It might seem like you are getting more work done at first, but this often leads to burnout, which consequently results in lower productivity.\nIt may seem counterintuitive, but you will actually get more done if you regularly step back to recharge your brain and body. Studies show that performance increases after breaks of all durations: from extended vacations down to microbreaks of 30 seconds. John Trougakos, Associate Professor of Management at the University of Toronto, says that mental concentration is similar to a muscle. Our focus becomes fatigued after sustained use and needs a rest period to recover, just like a bodybuilder resting between sets at the gym.\n==>Solution: Use the previously mentioned Pomodoro Technique to time how often and how long to take your well-deserved breaks. Feel free to play around and experiment with different frequencies and durations of breaks.\nWhat to do during your break: ==>1 listen to music ==>2 journal ==>3 doodle ==>4 meditate ==>5 play a quick game ==>3 go for a short walk outside",

A much better question might look like this:“Hey, I’m trying to return a string that displays the winner in Rock Paper Scissors, but I’m getting a syntax error on line 12. How can I fix this? Here’s my code.”  In sharing your attempt, people know what you’ve tried and won’t suggest things that might not have worked out for you. It also allows them to debug your current iteration of code, rather than sending you down a path that has you start all over again when you might be very close to a solution. Now, if you’re completely stuck with where to start, it’s completely fine to let people know that you’re stuck. Asking where you can start and what you can research to get on the right track empowers you to be able to resolve issues largely on your own in the future, and might even empower you to help others with the same issue later on.

            detail:"So you’ve spent some time struggling to solve the problem on your own, and now it’s time to fire up the Odin Discord and ask for help. The first thing to keep in mind is don’t ask to ask. While this is a simple idea (with a pretty catchy motto!), it can help you get answers to your questions much faster and will make it easier to others to feel comfortable offering you help.In addition, when you ask your questions, you should help the community help you by putting together a great question.\nWhen asking your question, please remember to include the context: ==>1.)What do you think the problem is? ==>2.)What exactly do you want to happen? ==>3.)What is actually happening? ==>4.)How did you get there? ==>5.)What have you tried so far?\nIf you can’t pinpoint the problem, you can share a screenshot. This is especially useful for showing the output of commands in the command line. In Discord, drag and drop your screenshot image file into the chat box to upload it or simply use the PrtScn and paste keyboard shortcuts. If you don’t know how to take a screenshot on your computer, this is a good time to ask Google.\nScreenshots are great for showing the output of commands or error messages in the command line. Screenshots are also great for showing the output from your code such as how the output looks visually on a webpage or console outputs in the browser. However, you should always include the corresponding files containing the error. Even if it is a short amount of code, providing it in the discord server in the proper format along with a screenshot of the output is helpful to those debugging it rather than just a screenshot. When you do share a screenshot of the output or how it looks visually make sure to push your project to GitHub or put your corresponding code in a replit so that others can comb through and debug the code. The screenshot of the output and the correlating code that can recreate the problem will help make it easier to understand the problem for people helping you. You’ll learn all about GitHub very soon. \nSometimes there might be no one around to help you with your issue. That is the ideal time to get familiar with the Discord search function. Search for specific keywords or error messages to see if anyone else had a similar issue before and how they solved it!",

While there’s no need for you to reenact the scene above, working with the command line is a critical skill for you to learn as a developer. The command line is like our base of operations, from which we can launch other programs and interact with them. It has a syntax of its own to learn, but since you’ll be entering the same commands dozens of times, you’ll quickly pick up the commands you need most.\nIn this introductory lesson to the command line, you’ll learn how to navigate around your computer and how to manipulate files and directories (also known as folders) directly from the comfort of the command line. You’ll soon see that this isn’t as difficult as you may think. The commands you will learn in this lesson are very straightforward.

That’s a long command to type out, and everything needs to be exactly right in order for it to work. Nope, we’re way too lazy for that! Basically, by hitting Tab, the command line will automatically complete commands that you’ve started typing once there’s only one option. For example, it’s pretty common to have a ```Documents``` folder and a ```Downloads``` folder in the ```home``` directory. If you’ve typed ```cd D``` and then press Tab, the command line will let you know that it’s not sure which one you want by showing you the different options that match what you’ve typed so far: ```bash $ cd D Documents/ Downloads/ $ cd D``` But once you’ve typed in a little bit more, it will complete the name for you, making it possible to write out the full file path above by typing as little as cd ```Doc[tab]O[tab]f[tab]j[tab]cal[tab]``` (depending on what other folders exist on your computer). Test it out, and get comfortable with how this works. You’re gonna love it. ",
            detail4:"Third, there’s a really handy shortcut for opening everything within a project directory: . Once you’ve installed a text editor, you can use this shortcut to open up an entire project and all its files in one go. This shortcut is also commonly used with Git (later on it’s covered in detail) with commands like ```git add .``` to add all the files inside of a directory into Git’s staging area. For example, if you have VS Code installed, you can cd into the project directory and then type ```code .``` (with the period) to open up all the project files.
