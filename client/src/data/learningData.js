            details1:"Generally, a website comprises two parts: the frontend (client-side) and the backend (server-side). The front end is what you see when you visit a site, and it includes HTML, CSS, and other languages like Javascript. While web designers are often responsible for the finer artistic aspects, developing a front end still requires being detail-oriented and balancing function and beauty. As for the backend, this includes all the operations going on invisibly in the background. A variety of languages like PHP, Ruby, and Python, and the various frameworks that go with them — though, backend developers tend to specialize in a select handful. Many backend developers are also responsible for managing the database and debugging any server-side issues that may occur. So, where do full-stack developers come into this? The answer: they specialize in everything! A full-stack developer can deal with problems on both the client- and server-side and set up a working website all by themselves. However, that doesn’t mean full-stack developers make front or backend developers obsolete, and you certainly shouldn’t expect to be fulfilling large projects all on your own. Full-stack development is a less specialized job, but it means you’re familiar with every step of web development. On the other hand, spreading your skills across a wide area means you’re often missing out on developing crucial skills, or half of your skillset may become unbalanced as you focus on specific areas. Still, being a full-stack developer has enormous advantages as it makes you highly flexible and able to work on different parts of a project as needed.",
